						<p class="left-hand">One only understands the things that one tames, said Saint-Exup√©ry. In a time when it has become so easy to travel across the globe, and when the countries we visit become but a score to display in our instagram bios, what is really left of the meaning of travel? Meaning is more often about depth than about breadth, and when it comes to travel, I believe this depth is to be sought in ourselves.</p>

						<p class="right-hand">It was in that spirit that in March 2019, I took a break from my studies in order to go visit the country which had been at the center of my attention and of my imagination for many years already: The United States of America. Precisely, I was flying to the South(ish) of the Eastern seabord, Washington D.C and its old neighbour, the deeply historical State of Virginia. </p>

						<p class="left-hand">Virginia is the oldest of the English colonies which became the United States of America after the Revolution of 1776. This is why we speak of colonial architecture, or colonial era when referring to its oldest historical buildings. It is a great land, mostly rural, home to an exceptional wine making industry. It retains remarkably expansive forests, including in the famous Blue Ridge Mountains with their distinctive hue that reminds me of the Vosges in my home country. </p>

						<p class="right-hand">Virginia played a major role in the creation of the American Republic. The buildings that immediately succeed to the Revolution bear a style that is known as <em>federal</em>. Exemples are plentiful in Washington D.C which was itself built around this time just next to Virginia which, from colony, had now become a <em>federal</em> State. The name given to this capital city, as well as to the impressive monument standing in the middle of the National Mall, is a tribute to the man who was perhaps the most famous of all Virginians: George Washington. </p>

						<p class="left-hand">As I undertook this voyage, I was particularly excited about the prospect of stepping on the places where all this history happened, and most particularly seing the places where the famous Founding Fathers of the United States had lived. Virginia was home to many of them, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson whose plantations of Mount Vernon and Monticello still exist. These domains are also memorials for the country's past association with slavery, and teach this history with sensitivity.</p>

						<p class="right-hand">It was at Mount Vernon that I was to live one of the most powerful experiences of these two weeks. I was paying my respects at the tomb of George Washington when a customary ceremony, the pledge of allegiance to the flag, was about to take place just there. Although not an American citizen myself, I have always admired the ideals this country has been defending and which I consider to be one and the same with these of my own country France. Therefore, it was very solemnly that I too, with my hand on my heart, had the honor of taking this pledge along with the other people around.</p>

						<p class="left-hand">All in all, I did not take many pictures during this trip. I ended up with only one roll exposed out of the five I had brought with me for my film slr, so 36 shots exactly! However, I love almost every single one of them and I realize that I had been thinking them through very carefully before taking any. This way of approaching my travel photography quite accurately mirrored the way I had been enjoying this trip in general, slowly, taking the time to discover and appreciate the landscapes, and to understand them.</p>

						<p class="right-hand">In Arlington, just across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial, lies one of the largest military cemetaries in the world. Many soldiers since the Civil War have their resting place there, as well as a few presidents. The endless lines of white graves is a very powerful sight, and several times I was moved to tears thinking about all the lives they represent.</p>

						<p class="left-hand">To people who know to pause and ponder at the meaning of stones, these emotions gather and unite in the capital, as if more than a political center, this city offered a silent sanctuary to the souls of the nation. Enshrined in the marble is the memory of so many individual sacrifices of women and men of courage, and of the timeless genius of visionaries who have inspired generations of Americans and liberty-loving people across the world. It is something to be experienced alone.</p>

						<p class="right-hand">As a historian of the United States, I am perfectly aware of the considerable distance between such ideals and the reality. And yet, this reality has always looked at these ideals for inspiration. In fact, we can only measure the reality against these ideals. As to the Romantic Virginia I had the priviledge to visit, I know that it exists first and foremost in my heart, as in the heart of anyone who believes in it. It is a land that shares its meaning and discloses its beauty only to them who take the time to tame it &FilledSmallSquare;</p>
