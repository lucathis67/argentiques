						<p>The name of this website, <em>Argentiques</em>, comes from the French <em>photographie argentique</em> which means film photography. It is a tribute to this traditional way of making photographs as it existed before the rise of everything digital (Much more about that to come in future posts). Not all the photographs on this website are film photographs, but many are because this venerable technology has been deeply impactful to the way I think about photography and practice this art.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="about-description">
						<p>In my work, I would say that three themes are recurrent in my photographs. The first is <em>time</em>, and its consequences. My fascination with time has also led me to study History at university in France and England. More precisely, I am a historian of American political philosophy.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="about-description">
						<p>The second theme which I hold dear is <em>space</em>. The sense of humility we can feel in the presence of greatness, marvelling at the simple and seclusive beauty of nature, or looking at the poetry of our presence in it, are so many different emotions I try to celebrate in photographs.</p>

					<div class="about-description">
						<p>The last and perhaps the most challenging to explore according to me is <em>life</em>. By nature an introvert, the act of deliberately going towards some aspects of modern life often requires a great deal of my energy. I nonetheless owe to photography some of the happiest moments in my life. Photography has a unique power to capture the most elusive emotions in life, and it has often allowed me to create the most beautiful and enduring memories for myself and for many others. I am particularly committed to sharing this inspiration.</p>
